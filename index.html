    <p>Dear Vistor,</p>
    <p>I hope that this letter arrives to you in better times than the one that this letter is written in. I hope that all is well. The silence is deafening, and I see no end. I spend what is left of my cognition worrying about the end. Here I sit so far removed from everything, I sometimes forget that all of this happening. However, I am reminded by my inability to be anywhere else. I hope that this letter and I can endure into better times. Although, the times have changed. I hope that I can still spread love in world lacking it. So, here are some hugs. OOOOOOOOO</p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>Yam</p>

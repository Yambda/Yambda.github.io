Dear vistor,

I hope that this letter arrives to you in better times than the one that this letter is 
written in. I hope that all is well. The Silence is deafening, and I see no end. I spend
what is left of cognition worrying about the end. Here I sit so far removed from everything,
I sometimes forget that all of this happening. However, I reminded by my inability to be
anywhere else. I hope that this letter and I can endure into better times.

Although, the times have changed. I hope that I can still spread love in world lacking
it. So, here are some hugs. OOOOOOOOO

Best Regards,

Yam
